In addition to my technical experience, I have acquired a powerful set of soft skills including research experience and leadership from my various hobbies and extracurricular activities. I've been a dedicated member of the debate team at Cal Poly, placing in the semifinals of both the Pan Pacific Cup and the Hawaiian Cup tournaments. I founded the only Engineering Fraternity at Cal Poly and grew the organization from 3 initial members to over 35. In addition to this, I'm an avid reader of current day trends in technology, ethics and politics.
